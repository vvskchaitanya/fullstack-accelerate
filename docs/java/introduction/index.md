# [Java](../) > Introduction

## What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, platform independence, and security. It is widely used for building applications in web development, mobile development, and enterprise software.

## Why Learn Java?
- **Easy to Learn** â€“ Java has a simple syntax similar to English.
- **Platform Independent** â€“ Java programs run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Object-Oriented** â€“ Java follows the OOP principles, making code reusable and modular.
- **Used Everywhere** â€“ From Android apps to enterprise solutions, Java is in demand.

## How Java Works
Java follows the **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** principle. This means you write the code once, and it can run on different devices without modification.

1. **Write Code** â€“ Developers write Java code in `.java` files.
2. **Compile Code** â€“ The Java compiler (`javac`) converts the code into bytecode (`.class` files).
3. **Run Code** â€“ The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode on different platforms.

## Basic Structure of a Java Program
Every Java program has a `main` method, which is the starting point of execution.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- `public class HelloWorld` â€“ Defines a class named `HelloWorld`.
- `public static void main(String[] args)` â€“ This is the main method where execution begins.
- `System.out.println("Hello, Java!");` â€“ Prints text to the console.

## Java Features
Java has several powerful features:
1. **Simple** â€“ Easy-to-understand syntax.
2. **Object-Oriented** â€“ Everything in Java is based on objects.
3. **Portable** â€“ Java programs can run on any OS.
4. **Secure** â€“ Java has built-in security mechanisms.
5. **Multithreading** â€“ Supports multiple tasks running simultaneously.

## Java Data Types
Java has two main types of data:
1. **Primitive Data Types** â€“ `int`, `char`, `boolean`, `float`, etc.
2. **Non-Primitive Data Types** â€“ `String`, `Arrays`, `Classes`, etc.

Example of using different data types:
```java
int number = 10;
String message = "Java is awesome!";
boolean isFun = true;
System.out.println(message);
```

## Java Control Statements
Control statements help in decision-making and looping:
- **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `if-else`, `switch`
- **Loops:** `for`, `while`, `do-while`

Example of an `if` statement:
```java
int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
```

## Java OOP Concepts
Java follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which includes:
1. **Classes and Objects** â€“ Blueprints for creating real-world entities.
2. **Inheritance** â€“ Allows one class to inherit from another.
3. **Polymorphism** â€“ Enables multiple methods with the same name.
4. **Encapsulation** â€“ Restricts access to data using access modifiers.
5. **Abstraction** â€“ Hides implementation details.

Java is a powerful language that is beginner-friendly and widely used in the industry. Understanding the basics of Java is the first step toward mastering programming.
