# [Java](./../java) > History and Evolution

## Introduction
Java is one of the most influential programming languages in the world. It was designed to be simple, platform-independent, and secure, making it widely used for web applications, enterprise solutions, and mobile development.

## Origins of Java
Java was created by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** in the early 1990s. Initially, it was developed as a project called **Oak**, intended for embedded systems and interactive television. However, Oak did not gain traction, and the project was renamed **Java** in 1995.

### Why the Name "Java"?
The name "Java" was inspired by Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. The developers were brainstorming names and wanted something unique, dynamic, and easy to remember. Since they were coffee enthusiasts and frequently drank coffee while coding, they decided to name the language **Java**.

### Why the Coffee Cup Symbol?
The coffee cup logo symbolizes the origin of the name and the energy that Java developers get from coffee. It also represents Java's promise of providing a robust and stimulating programming experience, much like a strong cup of coffee.

### Key Goals of Java:
1. **Platform Independence** – Programs should run on any operating system.
2. **Object-Oriented Design** – Code should be reusable and modular.
3. **Robustness & Security** – Avoid system crashes and security vulnerabilities.
4. **Simplicity** – Easy to write, read, and maintain.

## Evolution of Java
Java has evolved significantly since its initial release, introducing new features and enhancements in every version.
